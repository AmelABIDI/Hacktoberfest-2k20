# Personal project contribution

- Add one of your personal projects to enrich the repo!
- Make sure to include a README.md in your project folder (contains project description & how to run it)
- Ask people to add specific features to your uploaded projects as a challenge. (open an issue & specify it in a **labeled issue**:bookmark::pushpin:)
