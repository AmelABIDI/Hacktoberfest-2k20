All contribution is welcome (_adding features‚ú®, bug fixüîß, bug reportüêõ, upload projectsüì±, design‚úíÔ∏è, documentationüìù, fixing typos ...etc_). but we prefer **quality over quantity** so avoid making 5 PRs to fix 5 obvious grammar mistakes just to get the challenge completed faster (it may not be merged).
